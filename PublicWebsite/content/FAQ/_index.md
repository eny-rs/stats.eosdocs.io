#### Why am I seeing "old" data?

Each timeslot you're looking at represents the hour of data. So if you're looking at a column labeled 9pm .. this represents data between 9:00 pm and 9:59 pm. 

For us to calculate the averages for the hour of 9 pm we need to wait for the clock to tick over into 10 pm. So, you can see how we're able to only calculate the column labeled 9pm after 10pm. 

But wait it's 15 minutes past the hour and I still don't see the data update ... that's because there's a LOT of data to process and because we havenâ€™t fixed the timer in the backend to run at exactly the change of hour. Working on this.

#### How can I see who voted for a BP during that timeslot?

Simple, just click on the cell. The page that opens will show you all account that have voted for that BP during that timeslot. 

#### The voter detail page is pretty simple ... I want feature X

We're working on it. We wanted to get a tool into your hands as fast as possible. We'll be making regular improvements. 

We'd love your feedback though. Came and chat to us in the Telegram channel over at https://t.me/eosnewyorkchat 

#### You think the data is wrong?

We're not perfect .. it's possible we have a few kinks to iron out .. let us know if you spot something odd please.
